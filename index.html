                        Shannonside Brewery Company came into exsistance when four friends from the Midlands, with a
                        shared of love of great tasting beer and the river Shannon, decided to open a brewery.
                        Back in 2017, after a day of boating and fishing we went to the local to quench our thirst and
                        found the options available to us were limited (that didn't stop us partaking in a few pints all
                        the same).
                        We put our heads together in our favourite spot and laid out the idea for our new venture,
                        "Shannoneside Brewing Company", or SBC for short.

                    <p>From humble beginnings in a garden shed in 2017, the first SBC prototype was brewed. A beautiful
                        IPA we called "SBC No.1", I know, not very original! But it was the seed of something more, our
                        love for brewing, like that seed, grew, and a year and a half later we opened the doors to the
                        "Shannonside Brewing Company" brewery in our home town on the banks of the river Shannon. We
                        took our range of beers on the road, to conventions, pubs and off licences all over the country,
                        and to date you can find an SBC beer in almost every town in Ireland.

                    <hr>
                    <p>We take the finest Irish Malted Barley and add hops from all over the world. Small batch beers
                        are created with passion and care. We mix the malt with hot water (mash in) allowing enzymes to
                        convert some of the starch in the malt into sugars. This creates a sugary malty liquid called
                        wort. The wort is then boiled for an hour or so. During the boil, hops are added at different
                        stages to add to the flavour and aroma of the beer.</p>

                    <p>At Shannonside Brewing Company we embrace a progressive, eco-driven brewing process, that in turn
                        gives our customers the choice to make a difference when selecting their beer. Our employees
                        actively promote the natural ingredients and hand crafted ethos behind all of our beers and we
                        take our position as a provider of a sustainable working craft brewery evry seriously.

                        Not only is it important inside the brewery to promote a sustainable future but it is equally
                        important that as a cornerstone of craft brewing in the Midlands we also support the local
                        community
                        that through various initiatives and our young, talented workforce.</p>
